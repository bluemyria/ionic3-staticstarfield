== static star field ==
for wide field astrophotography: calculate the exposure time for your camera in order to minimize star trailing.

If you have a camera on a normal tripod there is a maximium exposure time (shutter speed) for a certain focal length of your camera/camera lens before the stars apear as trails rather than small dots due to the rotation of the earth.
